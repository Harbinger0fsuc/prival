                <p>Once your order has left us, you will receive an email containing an air waybill number to track its progress online. If you are a registered customer, you can also follow your delivery by signing into your account and selecting 'My Orders'.</p>

                <p>You can rest assured that we'll keep your purchase safe until it reaches you. Your order is insured against theft and accidental damage during delivery. Once your purchases have been delivered to the specified address and signed for, they are no longer covered by insurance. If you are unavailable when your package arrives, our courier will make two more attempts to deliver your purchase.</p>
                <p>If you won't be in, you can choose to waive the signature on the shipping page at checkout. Please be aware that if no signature is collected, you agree to our terms and conditions and take full responsibility for any loss or damage that may occur. Please note, orders containing items of high value may still require a signature, even if you did not select to sign for your order on arrival.</p>
